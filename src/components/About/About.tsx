            A bunch of houseplant lovers just like you. We are here for you every step of your houseplant journey, from
            our store to your home. We aim to inspire and create a retreat from the urban setting, rooted in the belief
            that plant care is self-care. Our staff is here to provide lived-experience and hands-on plant advice from
            repotting to design, and beyond. We pride ourselves on our selection of beautiful, healthy, and unique
            plants; from small, rare collector plants to large, statement specimens, and everything in between.
